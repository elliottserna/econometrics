## Statistics Resources: Texts

### [*OpenIntro Statistics*](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) (Diez, Çetinkaya-Rundel, & Barr)

Presents a comprehensive introduction to statistical ideas in a clear and accessible manner. This is a good text for any general audience, but especially for students with rudimentary understandings of statistics.

### [*Introduction to Modern Statistics*](https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/) (Çetinkaya-Rundel, & Hardin)

A derivative of *OpenIntro Statistics*, this text presents contemporary applications of statistics with connections to data science. This is a good text for data scientists or econometricians who want to understand statistics as it applies to their work with data.

> **Note:** You can also download the above two PDFs from this book's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/cornellpolicygroup/empirical-manual/tree/main/content/pdfs/causal_inference). 

### [*An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications*](https://math.emory.edu/~lchen41/teaching/2020_Spring/Larsen-5E.pdf) (Larsen & Marx)

Presents the mathematics behind our concepts of statistical theory as well as their applications. This is a good text for the math-inclined reader who wants to reference the mathematical intuition of statistics.
